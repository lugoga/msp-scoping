HE APPLICATION OF MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING
2.1	The Concept of Marine Spatial Planning
In developing a sustainable blue economy, the increasing demand for marine space throughout the URT, along with the multiple pressures on marine and coastal resources, requires a more integrated approach to the management of the URT’s marine space. Marine spatial planning (MSP) has increasingly been promoted globally as one tool that can help address complex conflicts in coastal and marine areas, particularly in heavily used marine areas. MSP provides a way to organise the use of the ocean space, as well as the interactions among uses and between users and the marine environment.
The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) identifies a number of tools and opportunities for the implementation of the blue economy (Figure 1). According to the blue economy definition for Africa (UNECA, 2016), MSP is essential for implementing the blue economy.

In the context of the sustainable blue economy, UNECA defines MSP as:
an integrative, adaptive, and participatory process that brings together multiple users of the ocean at various levels - including energy, industry, fisheries, oil and gas, government, conservation, and recreation - to make informed and coordinated decisions about how to use marine resources sustainably. (UNECA, 2016)
The 2050 AIMS (African Union 2012) confirms the importance of MSP as a tool for the implementation of the blue economy as a mechanism to balance competing sector-based interests. By establishing and planning the marine space for the economic activities, sectors and resources, it is recognised that MSP provides a policy process for the African Union, the Regional Economic Commissions and Member States to better determine how maritime zones can be sustainably used and protected. 
If the URT is to comprehensively develop a sustainable blue economy, MSP is an important tool to facilitate its development. For increasingly busy ocean spaces, MSP will allow the URT to promote and organise multiple uses as well as identifying sites for new and emerging uses. MSP can also be used as a tool for increasing investor confidence by introducing transparency and predictability, which can act as a catalyst for investment in innovation and developing blue technologies. It may also facilitate filling critical knowledge gaps on the ocean and key sectors (UNESCO-IOC, 2021).
2.2	Benefits of Adopting MSP
Across the URT, many government sectoral policy statements (including land, fisheries, environment, forestry, tourism, etc.) recognize the need for an integrated and participatory resource management approach to resolve issues and take advantage of development opportunities. MSP provides the mechanisms for achieving intersectoral management of resources and people in the coastal and marine domain. The benefits of a successful implementation of MSP in Tanzania include the following: 
Environmental Benefits	•	Assist the URT with the further identification of ecological important areas as the basis for expanding the current network of marine protected areas
•	Effective and efficient control of marine pollution
•	Strengthen incorporation of biodiversity conservation goals into planning and decision-making
•	Allocate space for biodiversity and nature conservation measures
•	Identify and reduce the impacts of harmful human uses on the marine environment
•	Identify and reduce the cumulative effects of human activities on marine ecosystems
•	Mitigate and adapt to climate change impacts
Economic Benefits	•	Provide greater certainty for new private-sector investment in terms of access to marine areas
•	Identify compatible and incompatible uses within the same development areas 
•	Reduce conflicts between incompatible uses and users
•	Improve capacity to plan for new and changing human activities, including emerging technologies and their associated effects
•	Streamline and strengthen planning and licensing procedures
Social Benefits	•	Increase community and citizen participation in marine planning and decision-making
•	Improve the transparency of impacts of decisions on the allocation of ocean space (e.g., closure areas for certain uses, protected areas) for communities and economies onshore
•	Identify and protect marine cultural heritage
•	Identify and protect social and spiritual values related to ocean use

Additionally, implementing MSP may deliver numerous positive added benefits, as it often provides an initial forum through which different stakeholders express their given interests related to a specific marine space. If well designed, an MSP process may lead to increased understanding of other stakeholders’ needs, and thus not only potentially limit conflicts, but create synergies and cross-sector cooperation fields, which may be outside the scope of the actual spatial planning dimension as such (e.g. economic cooperation) (GEF LME:LEARN, 2018).
It should be stressed that MSP alone will not be sufficient for the URT to realise a sustainable blue economy. The successful and sustainable development of a sustainable blue economy will also require governance and policies that integrate environmental and economic considerations. MSP should therefore be seen as complementary to the existing marine management structures that operate across the URT. As such, whilst MSP takes account of sectoral management, it does not replace single-sector management measures, which remain an important aspect of the overall ocean governance arrangements. Neither does it replace, or in any way detract from existing management tools, such as integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) and marine protected areas (MPAs), but rather relies on integration with such tools (UNECA, 2016).
 
2.2.1	Relationship between ICZM and MSP
The URT already has extensive experience with the development and implementation of integrated coastal zone management. Tanzania Mainland launched the National Integrated Coastal Management Strategy in 2003, as a mechanism to improve the living standards of the coastal people and revamp national development. Zanzibar developed its Integrated Coastal Zone Management Strategy (ICZM) in 2009. Furthermore, Zanzibar’s ICZM governance mechanism has been formalized in the Zanzibar Environmental Management Act No. 3 of 2015. Both ICZM and MSP are tools that attempt to override traditional sectoral approaches that lead to disconnected decisions and missed opportunities for more sustainable coastal development. Both tools broadly seek to address the same objectives through:
•	Integrating between levels of government and other management authorities (including across administrative boundaries);
•	Integrating between disciplines;
•	Integrating across spatial and temporal scales; and
•	Integrating stakeholders (interests) with special attention to local communities. 
Whilst MSP and ICZM, both involve a strategic approach to planning within the marine environment, in terms of uses and activities, the main difference between the two are the scales to which they can be applied. Typically ICZM is applied to marine zones less than two kilometres from the coastline, conversely MSP can be applied to much wider areas such as coastal watersheds or the EEZ.
In the context of the URT, there is an evident overlap of the geographical scope of ICZM and MSP since both include internal and territorial waters. From this perspective, MSP can be seen as one of the main tools for implementing ICZM in the marine part of the coastal zone. However, the application of MSP is far broader since it encompasses all of the URT’s maritime waters. 
2.3	Approaches to Implementing MSP
2.3.1	Essential requirements for MSP
A review of international MSP practice identifies a number of elements that are essential for the success of any future MSP process, including:
•	A robust institutional and legal framework for the governance of marine space;
•	Knowledge about current marine uses and activities and their impacts on the marine environment; 
•	Access to marine and coastal information to support planning and decision-making;
•	Mechanisms to support stakeholder engagement and involvement in planning and decision-making; 
•	Tools for the identification and resolution of user conflicts and assessment of cumulative impacts; 
•	Integration of MSP with existing ocean governance arrangements and coherence with existing land-use planning arrangements.
Whilst there is no single model for MSP, the development and implementation of MSP involves a number of steps and consists of at least four ongoing phases (Figure 2).
•	Process planning.
•	Goal setting and data collection
•	Spatial analysis and draft plan creation
•	Final plan preparation and implementation
 
Figure 2: Overview of the steps to be followed during the spatial planning process. 

The steps presented in Figure 2 do not simply represent a linear process that moves sequentially from one step to the next. In this regard, it should be clearly understood that MSP is not simply a plan, but rather a comprehensive planning process, often utilizing spatial planning tools. The principal output of MSP is a comprehensive spatial management plan for a marine area or ecosystem, which sets out priorities for the area and defines what these priorities mean in time and space. 
A spatial management plan can contain a map with: (1) clear designated areas for current uses; and (2) an indication of possible/planned areas for future use and development. In addition to such a map(s), a spatial management plan is likely to include planning policies to guide future developments. The plan should be designed to resolve both current conflicts as well as prevent future conflicts and foster synergies between uses. Accordingly, a future-oriented vision and corresponding goals and objectives should be included in the plan  (GEF LME:LEARN, 2018).
 
2.3.2	Global approaches to MSP
There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ model for MSP. Something that has worked in one country or region may not be applicable to another country. Geo-political, social and environmental conditions, maritime activities and related MSP issues differ substantially in marine areas around the globe. As a result, globally, countries are at very different stages of MSP development, with differing MSP resource availability and varying governance systems both for national processes as well as transnational cooperation. 
Moreover, planning cultures differ substantially, which impacts how a marine spatial plan is adopted in national legislation. In some cases, countries may focus on establishment of specific zones and exact allocation of maritime activities; whereas other countries may focus more on establishing principles and strategic planning criteria. Table 1 below provides a sample list of different types of plans developed as a result of an MSP process.

TYPE OF PLAN	EXAMPLES	DESCRIPTION
National plan with spatial allocations	Maritime Spatial Plan for the Belgian Part of the North Sea,	This plan lays out principles, goals, objectives, and long-term vision, and spatial policy choices for the management of the Belgian territorial sea and EEZ.
	Belize Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan	This plan covers both coastal and territorial seas of Belize and sets out action plans which are supported by zoning/spatial schemes for the management of coastal and marine human activities/uses.
	Seychelles Marine Spatial Plan	The plan is being developed in phases and takes a multi sector approach to zoning the entire EEZ for marine protected areas, and multiple uses in addition to an implementation plan.
National integrated plan	Ireland - Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth – an Integrated Marine Plan	This sets out a roadmap for the Government’s vision, high-level goals and integrated actions across policy, governance and business to enable Ireland‘s marine potential to be realised. Implementation of this Plan will see Ireland evolve an integrated system of policy and programme planning for marine affairs.
	National Framework for Marine Spatial Planning in South Africa	The framework adopted in 2017, delivers high level directions for developing MSP in the context of existing legislation, policies and planning regimes in South Africa. It also sets out the processes for developing and implementing marine area plans to ensure consistency across the entire EEZ.
Multi-Level Plans	Sweden	Three distinct plans for separate areas, covering the territorial sea from 1 nm outward of the base line and the EEZ, are under preparation by the same national authority; whilst coastal regions also have the right to prepare their plans up to 12 nm.
	United Kingdom	In the UK, the preparation of marine plans is the responsibility of the respective governments within the UK. For example, Scotland has prepared Scotland’s National Marine Plan, which provides a single framework for managing Scotland’s seas. This plan will be supplemented by eleven Regional Marine Plans, prepared by the Marine Planning Partnerships.
	Germany	There is no hierarchy between the different plans prepared for the two EEZs (Baltic Sea and North Sea) and the three plans prepared by each of the coastal states; e.g. the plan prepared by MecklenburgVorpommern for its 12 nm zone is not under a hierarchical order of the plan prepared by the Federal Government for the Baltic Sea EEZ.

2.3.3	MSP experience in the Western Indian Ocean
At a WIO regional level, the Secretariat of the Nairobi Convention for the Protection, Management and Development of the Marine and Coastal Environment of the Western Indian Ocean (Nairobi Convention) has established a marine spatial planning technical working group whose functioning is integrated into the WIOSAP, SAPPHIRE and NoCAMO projects. The MSP technical working group responds to a need for improved regional cooperation to establish a consistent and appropriate definition of MSP that will serve the needs of WIO countries. It aligns with two decisions of the 8th Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Nairobi Convention held in Seychelles in 2015:
(i)	Decision CP8/10: Blue and Ocean Economy (4) “To urge Contracting Parties to cooperate in improving the governance of areas beyond national jurisdiction, building on existing regional institutions including the Nairobi Convention and developing area-based management tools such as marine spatial planning to promote the blue economy pathways in the Western Indian Ocean Region.”
(ii)	Decision CP8/13: Enhancing Cooperation, Collaboration and Support with Partners (3) “To invite all Contracting Parties and request the Secretariat to collaborate with the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association and other partners on capacity building, implementation and sharing of experiences on integrated marine spatial planning in support of blue economy.
Individual countries of the WIO have developed and adopted MSP approaches for different purposes. The levels of implementation vary across countries, with more advanced processes having been implemented in Seychelles. Implementation in Kenya and Mauritius remains at an earlier stage.  Broadly speaking, it can be seen that the evolution of MSP is directly aligned to the increased interest in the blue economy: The both Seychelles and Kenya have adopted the blue economy concept;  Mauritius is investing in the ‘ocean economy’; and the Republic of South Africa has developed Operation Phakisa, to unlock the economic potential of the ocean in a sustainable manner (Celliers, 2017). 
•	In Seychelles, MSP began in February 2014 as a process focused on planning for the sustainable and long-term use of the nation’s extensive ocean space. The Seychelles MSP builds upon existing MPA planning efforts, and is a necessary output of the Seychelles debt conversion, in which the government committed to expanding marine biodiversity protection to 30% of the EEZ and territorial sea by 2020. MSP is a government-led process in the Seychelles, with planning and facilitation led by TNC.
MSP has been framed as an integrated, multi-sector approach to address climate change adaptation, marine biodiversity protection and support the blue economy. The process has a robust stakeholder engagement framework to develop a comprehensive marine plan with stakeholder input. More than 11 marine sectors and civil society participate in the MSP, including fishing, tourism, marine charters, biodiversity conservation, renewable and non-renewable energy, ports and maritime safety.  With pre-planning and extensive consultation processes completed, the marine plan is in the process of being approved. Major outputs to date include a Seychelles MSP Policy Seychelles, a Seychelles Marine Spatial Plan Atlas (Figure 3), and three phases of new MPA gazettement.3

•	In Kenya, MSP has been adopted as a step towards unlocking the country’s blue economy development potential. This focuses on identifying opportunities for economic development, whilst also facilitating improved sustainable management of the marine environment, including both coastal and offshore fishery resources, through an ecosystem-based management (EBM) approach. Some of the key drivers for MSP in Kenya for developing the blue economy include proposed investments planned in shipping, aquaculture, tourism, fishing, and marine resource management. Plans for an expansion of port activities, including new port developments, are also driving factors.
Although the implementation of a marine spatial plan for Kenya is yet to be realized, some pre-planning has been completed. A multi-sectoral Interagency Working Group has been constituted under the State Department for Fisheries, Aquaculture and the Blue Economy (SDFABE) to guide the development of MSP. The Government of Kenya is now initiating the process to develop a marine spatial plan with support from development partners including the World Bank, the Federal Government of Germany and TNC.  
•	Mauritius has begun to advance MSP as a means of strengthening its eco-nomic diversification in key maritime sectors, such as port infrastructure, shipping, tourism, fisheries, and marine renewable energy. Mauritius has established a MSP Coordinating Committee, which led to the identification of key bio-diversity areas in the region. Key drivers include the need to establish a comprehensive system of multi-use marine planning for transparent, sustainable, and evidence-based decision-making, as well as intentions to set up an Ocean Observatory E-platform to centralize data (McAteer et al. 2022). 
The Department for Continental Shelf, Maritime Zones Administration and Exploration has been granted national authority for MSP. As current coastal management in Mauritius is narrowed to only include areas within one km from the high tide watermark, MSP is intended to harmonize the scope of coastal management with the whole EEZ.
Annex C of this report provides two brief case studies, for South Africa and Australia respectively, illustrating how different States have approached the development and implementation of MSP.
